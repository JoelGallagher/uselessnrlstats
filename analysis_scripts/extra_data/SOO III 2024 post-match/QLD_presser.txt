yeah yeah I feel like I feel like the team was defeated and certainly didn’t feel like a loss I was disappointed after Melbourne I don’t feel disappointed right now I feel immensely proud of this playing group and what they had to endure out there and they kept turning up and we just couldn’t quite get it done tonight yeah absolutely I think it ended up being a hundred more tackles that we had to do the first half we just felt like we were on our line a whole heap and just things weren’t going our way it didn’t feel like we got the bounce of the ball or the rub of the green so that tells at the end with fatigue but like I said I couldn’t be any more proud of this team I don’t think we could’ve given any more effort the effort was there all night the effort was obviously really clear to see in the first half so we did our best tonight and it wasn’t good enough and well right now that’s hard to understand because you give everything but there has to be a loser and unfortunately it's us this year nah its just been a bit of a thing with the series to be fair just all that sort of stuff niggle I guess yeah and it just sort of boiled over and just really proud of the way that no one hesitated to get in there feel like I got a lot of love and support from my teammates tonight so yeah really proud of that side of the game yep feel pretty clear that’s pretty unacceptable at any level of footy but yeah that’s just my opinion but yeah that’s footy they’ve got to make a decision yeah I thought we were going to get the penalty but again just Bill used the phrase rub of the green just didn’t get the rub of the green tonight so we live with that and that’s footy I’m sure the referee will review his own game I’m sure his boss will review his game no I just think that’s their job to review their own game their own performance to be honest I don’t know the rules in that situation that’s what they’ve come up with I’m sure they’ll review their own performance and their own decisions no I was there that night there’s obviously maybe a couple of little resemblances but I was too close to the fight tonight compared to the battle of Brooky so it’s very different in that regard just the amount of defence that we were doing the amount of possession or lack of possession we had I just feel we’re in a pretty good position four two I don’t think we’d change that decision no no I’m not disappointed in the playing group I’m immensely proud of their efforts I think the state of Queensland would be super proud of their footy team they should be proud of themselves tonight so I don’t feel like that yeah yeah nah he’s a player he’s tough he’s a great fella he’s still got a huge career in front of him so he’s a little competitor Tommy I think yeah no certainty he was getting hit without the footy so I think given the situation we were in on the scoreboard having them both out there was our best option so yeah yep they will review their own game I’m sure they will look at that see whether I just said I thought he was hit a little bit off the footy so that’s what I think I don’t know it’s a game of rugby league its at state of origin level I’ve been out there I know what it’s like I understand what he’s going through it’s just the way it is isn’t it yeah well if it was panic it was panic ten days earlier than the game so we knew exactly where we were going with our team probably still make those changes that’s just the decision we made we thought that was gonna be our best start and it doesn’t change anything I’m still proud of the team proud of the way that they fought courageously defended their tryline they did a great job so you can look at all these things in hindsight and go I should’ve done that I shouldn’t’ve done that I’m not looking at that right now I would’ve preferred to hold the shield up and the feeling in the dressing room be a bit different but like I said I was disappointed after Melbourne I just didn’t feel we played as we didn’t give ourselves a chance we gave ourselves a chance tonight they’re a good footy team they’ve done a lot right so yeah obviously it’s not good losing but you can’t win them all you can’t win everything I’ve been around this game too long to understand that you can’t win everything so to stand up and do their state proud I think that’s what I’m proud of look I still thought we were a chance with five minutes to go with three minutes to go we’ve got a footy team there and I never thought we were gone until that last set when New South Wales got the ball so there was just a period in the game where fatigue got a hold of us and they scored a couple of tries they’re a good footy team they hung in there too so yeah as Bill said it was origin footy tonight it was rough two nil halftime don’t know I’m not one the best looking guys in the game so I’ll be right I’m lucky I’ve got a partner no that was the plan like I thought he did a great job he was very impressive throughout the week as well I thought he did a great job defensively in the middle of the field he took the line on would’ve liked to get him in a bit more space but that wasn’t to be I think he was good why not I’ve played with Karmichael Hunt I’ve played alongside Darius Boyd Kalyn has played alongside Reece Walsh sometimes you can look at the footy and you look at positions and you can go with the traditional or you can actually be innovative and think of different ways to play the game I’m not saying that that’s what we did Kalyn just went on in the middle of the field but there’s all those options out there maybe we just don’t explore them enough I’m not sure yeah I can’t see why not I can’t see why not no when you’ve got guys like Pat Carrigan and Reuben Cotter that can play huge minutes and yeah we took Reuben off and then we were just looking for an opportunity to get him back on there so when you’ve got that flexibility in your team you can have a bit of a flexible bench so yeah that’s just the way it went yeah look it’s I get it I work in the media I get the build up I get the excitement around it I get the public reading into all the reports and all that but sitting here in this position I honestly don’t hear it I turn all my stuff off I don’t read the news I don’t hear it until I stand in front of a press conference and people ask me questions so I’ve got a job to do for this footy team and that’s be the coach and help them be at their best for that eighty minutes of footy a that’s all I focus on and I’ll turn it all back on now when I go back to work for channel nine and I’ll be one of them talking about it but honestly for this six week period I try and block out all the noise so when you ask about the spitefulness I don’t hear it until I stand in front of a press conference
