its a good start yeah I felt that that's definitely in the players and obviously I go back to that first campaign and you know I think the boys had actually set up what we did in that campaign it was both campaigns have been great but we also know we've got a job ahead of but the way the players played in that first half is something that we'd spoken about and it was nice to see that the leaders went out and controlled the game and what you saw in the first half is what I believe this group is very capable of and we've just got to replicate that moving forward thanks well I've gotta say the way the group has come together way back in probably when I first started talking to the players they've shown me what they're hungry for and I think that performance in the first half is definitely something that every single conversation I've had with each individual and it's probably outside just this group as well to be able to create that but we also know we've got work to do and this group is really keen and very hungry to get in and do it yeah it was great obviously to get to play at the MCG you know is really special in itself and just the way we just went about it as Madge said we had a really great preparation it was really good clear week everyone was yeah everyone was at their best throughout the whole week so led to a great performance but I think you know we really did deserve it we worked really hard for it and yeah it was just nice really nice yeah I mean making sure that I credit the guys that have been in the first campaign like you don't know what could have happened in that game obviously but you know Mitch has come and he did what I believe he is capable of doing and I think what we all thought he was capable of doing you know he kicked well and I thought he jumped well into the campaign straight up when he first walked in he was strong with the way he wanted to play the game but everyone just jumped on board and did their jobs I think all of them not only Mitch but Dylan Edwards out the back I thought he was excellent you know he's just shown that he's an Origin player and I said that from say one when I first picked and the you've got Latrell coming in and he just played his part for the team which was great you know Romey did his job but I thought you know someone like Payne Haas and Jake they laid the platform so you know we all they all just jumped in together and made sure that they played their part for the team which is something there that they've spoken about as a group and what they want to be able to achieve so we've got to take that forward now yeah but when you've got the calibre of players around someone like Latrell it just allows him to go and do what he needs to do rather than singling out one player I mean Latrell is a great player we all know that and where he's at at the moment and how he's playing his footy has been great but when everyone else plays their part it allows someone like a Latrell to shine and do the things that we all admire in what he does yeah he's doing really well and jus the way Zac talks about his footy and look I've know Zac for quite some time now and his maturity around his footy and what he wants to do and achieve in his footy is great and I thought you know he's kicked two goals from the sidelines so it just goes to show that these big games are something there that he goes after like all of them but yeah I was really pleased with the way the boys defended I think that's probably the shining light I guess of what I see in the team that to be a strong defensive you've all got to work together and they didn't miss too many tackles in that first half which means they're working hard for each other cause you've gotta work hard defensively and that's something there that goes to show the character of the team and what they're trying to build well they're things that we can have a look at obviously moving into game three there was a few interesting calls there around what was made but at the end of the day you know we'll talk about that internally and as you saw in the first half you know what they're capable of so we gotta make sure we stick to that well you gotta make sure that what wins games is that part of the discipline that you need and obviously I like to see my players look after each other and I think that's part of what New South Wales stands for but you've also gotta make sure that you're smart about those moments because that can come back and get you it's about being smart along the way with what you're doing and it's nice to see the players just the connection of what they've got at the moment we've gotta bottle that and make sure we take that moving forward well you work on every single player I think the kicking game the way the boys played in the first half just isolates individuals and takes away the qualities of what they are and that's what you're meant to do yeah one thing about this group they don't really look into any of that they just working hard on helping each other out and working for each other so wherever you got to go and play you've gotta play so this group they're looking internally rather than probably looking externally so I guess that's something there that we'll talk about but ultimately at the end of the day it's the same field you've gotta play and you know they found their game tonight and that's what we've gotta take forward one thing it can be done it can definitely be done it's shown that and if this group gets together like they have in this game well there's no reason why things can't be done he just had a little bump he's right just a little bruise no just a little bruise yeah well I mean you look at that and yeah he's doing that at training he only practices that so there's reasons why players get to the quality of who they are it's because they practice and yeah you see in every game that he's played he's competing he's a real competitor and obviously we were able to isolate that edge and he went up and scored a good try and the best part about that was the fact not the fact you saw all the team get around him when he scored that try that was really pleasing you sort of see the enjoyment that the players are getting out of their teammates coming up with plays like that because that's his quality that he brings along with what they did on the other side where they scored on the other side and I guess as a coach it's nice to see your players embracing each other when you're seeing those moments on the field there's a fair bit of Queensland sort of calls there but walking out there just at the end and hearing everyone chanting about New South Wales was nice to see so yeah definitely would like to come back look I just called out what I saw you know we've got a really tight group within us and I felt that there were probably a few things thrown in a certain way you know I just called it out that's all I did I think that's something there that the team supports each other in looking after each other and you probably saw that out there and we've gotta get the discipline around that right but at the end of the day I was just stating the fact that a few things were said about one of my players and we're a tight group so I'm going to support that I can't actually remember that one I'd have to go back and have a look yeah but I don't think there's too much in that it's an origin game that was an interesting one that was yeah that was a weird call but anyway I'll we'll move on it's a great opportunity for us obviously tonight we come in and really good performance that we take some confidence from that but I think it's a great opportunity for us it's really exciting and we'll just go up there and give it a red hot crack
