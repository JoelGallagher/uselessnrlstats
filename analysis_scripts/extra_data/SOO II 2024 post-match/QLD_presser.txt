yeah yeah I think the whole dressing room in there is pretty disappointed It was a tough old first half just felt like we were running uphill and we just couldn't stop the momentum of the game and you know part of that is on us so you know we'll look at our game and work out what we need to adjust and what we need to go after and I think I do is there's another game in three weeks time yeah I thought the start was ok actually I thought the first eight nine minutes it a bit of a tussle and then new south wales just got a snowball of possession and you know we held them out for a few sets and then they broke and got a try and yeah just sort of went downhill from there yeah it's a tough game to play Joel it's a lot tougher when you're tired so like I said it snowballed against the team yeah probably best described as a snowball momentum swings yeah they were yeah they were on top of us there and we just couldn't halt the momentum so yeah its a bit for us to work on yeah origin is pretty physical this one probably felt more physical because of the running they had of momentum so we'll learn a lot from tonight I have unfortunately yeah a couple so yeah not nice yeah I thought the second half was quite good I'm not sure what the second half score was but I thought our actions the way we started the second half we went after our footy a little bit more we were a little bit more patient we weren't looking for any shortcuts to draw back the scoreline you know so yeah that's a positive in the second half but yeah there was too many things in that first half on our behalf you know that we didn't do as well as we would have liked and we all know yeah I think he's picked up an AC injury so yeah it was a pretty tough effort for him to get back out there he obviously wasn't a hundred percent but he knew the team needed him it's a hard game to play it's even harder when you're tired I think it was nearly seventy thirty possession in that first half and you know the scoreline reflected that so any individuals it's going to be hard for them so that's where we're at it's a real positive that the group pulled themselves together at half time after the fuel tank that they used and played the footy in the second half but we don't want to be in that position I haven't even thought of that we're still Queenslanders wouldn't have a clue he's done a AC so I don't know I don't have the answer for that yeah well we're from Queensland yeah I said I haven't thought of that and I said we're still Queenslanders so that's it I don't know I haven't thought about it I honestly haven't thought about it well when you have thirty percent possession in the first half everyone has to do a lot of defence I think we'd made double the amount of tackles than New South Wales in the first half that's a huge amount of defence not just any edge everyone on the mic from I think Chex got hit off the ball once there that I can remember but the game was moving so fast you know we were a fair way away up there as well so you know to try and find the replays and keep up with the speed of the game so look we'll find a whole heap of stuff in our review I'll go over a loot of angles and stuff I'll do my job but yeah I'll make a comment on that later maybe well that's an experience that some players in this group have been through that was a tough night over in Perth and you know things snowballed against us on that night as well so we are going back to the same venue so see how we go well he's a good player he's a good player and no one denies that and when you're playing against a fatigued footy team you know it helps so I'm more worried about our players yeah the players that were involved in it will take some experiences from it but no two series are ever the same so there's still a lot of desire there regardless of the result tonight we still want it more than ever and we need to show that in our performance next game and you know after a loss like that that next game for a player can't come quick enough so looking forward to it I mean that's a tough question to answer it's origin footy and the refs are out there doing their best so we just trust that they're doing their best job and I'm sure they did their best job tonight and that's just footy yeah I don't know I don't know what it's called we just lost and we need to cop it on the chin and move on we know what Suncorp is it's a great venue it brings a great atmosphere it's a decider they're great games to be a part of they're wonderful games to be a part of you know we've been fortunate enough to be a part of those sort of games and there was one there a couple of years ago so that doesn't mean anything unless we address what happened in the first half and we'll do that we'll go through our game and work out what we can do better I'll look at my performance through the last ten days like we're all looking at each other and ourselves so we've got to look at that and we've got to take our best performance to Suncorp sorry I live here I'm not moving
