yeah yeah no uh like I’m always proud of this footy team um you know the way that they prepare the way that they carry themselves uh you know they’re a credit to themselves as leaders of our state and it’s not just me I could imagine what five point five million people above the border there are feeling about their footy team and pride would be at the top of the list yeah yeah he seems to be ok now uh he didn’t look to good on the field obviously but he seems to be ok in the sheds no definitely not I thought like the team’s adapted to adversity the last three years you know you think back to last year and you know Adelaide we had both our wingers go off the field we had centres playing on the wing we had Dave Fifita playing in the centres Ben Hunt was playing in the centres the team’s been accustomed to adapt to adversity and that’s no different to tonight um you know I thought Hammer was great just slipping back into that fullback position and everyone else Felise Kaufusi came on the field and done a great job you know Selwyn look hindsight is a great thing but you know it worked out in our favour Selwyn yeah well that’s his position he plays there weekly like he’s prepared to play there um you know we prepared for the unexpected and the unexpected happened I’ll keep my feelings about that to myself I’ve no idea but I’ll my feelings about that to myself did you ok people care what you think don’t underestimate yourself to be honest I walked up to the box from the sideline yesterday in the captain’s run and I just thought to myself that if that is needed then that’s what I’m going to do and we actually had a talk about that today as a staff um and when hammer got thrown back to fullback I just felt that I could help him with a few things just um having a face to face conversation um you know we didn’t you can’t plan for everything but that’s one thing I felt was beneficial to the team beneficial to hammer and um yeah I just felt it at the time so I did it yeah he did a great job didn’t he under the high ball positionally you know not just scoring three tries but he saved probably just as many getting underneath Spencer Leniu that’s not easy and I think he held up James Tedesco there at one stage too so um he did a wonderful job to adjust um to a different position I know he platys there every week and you that’s a great luxury but I thought he was super I just think I think Hunty plays with a whole heap of spirit you know he typifies the Queensland spirit and he’s done that every time he pulls the jersey on um he’s a real competitor we all know that um but he just always he’s always in the game and you know he’s a wonderful player um I think the bloke next to me would attest to the leadership he brings to this footy team as well um you know he’s a captain at club he’s pretty much a captain at this level too like we’re very fortunate to have a guy like Ben Hunt out there um leading our spirit and leading our footy well I feel the great leaders do their job in their positions and that’s the first thing that Daly gets right um I thought his commitment to the defensive side of the game was first class uh you know he put our team in good positions you know turning the ball over and making that last play like he’s a smart footy player um you know that’s why he’s the leader of this footy team um you know his preparation was great his preparation for his team was great and like we’ve got so much room we’ve got so much to go with our footy I thought we were so far of with our footy tonight um but that’s all to come yeah I don’t think I don’t think we played the way we prepared uh there is there’s so much more for this footy team and um that’s that’s exciting um its not for now now is about the feeling and this feeling that they’re getting right now in the dressing rooms its that’s like I you know I played my last origin six years ago um the feeling is what you remember and that’s what they’re soaking up right now yeah I’m so proud um so so happy to be a friend of his um off the field as well um he works hard he get what’s he deserves out there and I know he’s a leader I’ve learnt over time it’s not a one man job and uh the relationship with the coach is important and the senior players in the squad is really important and Ben Hunt is definitely a leader of this side and certainly someone I lean on yeah well they had a second rower um in the centres so just naturally wanted to find the imbalance of the numbers and naturally we wanted to probably stay asway from uh yeah um Crichton so yeah we just I mean eyes up footy yeah like we said we’ve got a lot of footy left in us but I think we did well given the situation how did I see it yes pretty pretty standard I reckon yeah there’s not much to probably argue about it it is what it is and refs are under pressure out there they made the right decision and the game went on and wasn’t ideal and as Reece as Billy said as long as Reece is alright that’s the main priority out of all that yeah look it’s just um its not necessarily about silencing anyone its about what we’re trying to achieve here so um we got to enjoy this moment um knowing there’s more work to go and more improvement in us and that’s the most exciting part and yeah like I said we’ll enjoy it now and worry about it in twelve days time but yeah its nice to get a win um I honestly don’t know if it counts for anything if you don’t go out there and earnt he next two wins so um they’re not going to give us anything it’s all about us and as Bill said we’ve got a lot of improvement left in us so we’ll take the win on their home soil but there’s so much work to be done and I’m excited about it
