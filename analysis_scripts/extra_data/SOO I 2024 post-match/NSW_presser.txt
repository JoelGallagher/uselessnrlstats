yeah playing as this level uh playing with twelve um but you know I  I just spoke to the players there about how hard they wanted to work for each other through those throughout the game I thought you know we put ourselves actually in positions at times where you know we were quite dominant but uh I guess you know fatigue comes in at some stage but uh you know playing a longer game and you know when you’re playing sort of with a man down its you know you got to sort of really try and bury the opposition into the corners and you know fatigue finds you at some stage but you know I’m actually really super proud of their efforts I’ve got to say look individuals were out on their feet and um yeah so it made it a bit tough but you know one thing I do know about this this group is they’ve really shifted the dime on where they see and how hard they want to work for the jersey so that’s something there you know we’ll continue to push moving forward well I think uh earlier on in the year he uh he ended up with a broken jaw I think and there was no send off um you know so it’s a big call at this at this level I mean its you know tackle you know he was falling and um but again I’ll have to have another look at it but you know I think it’s a massive call for a game like this I’d imagine he’s got a fair bit of emotion rolling around inside at the moment but the one thing we gonna do is that we get around him that’s that’s what we do um you know as you just said they made the decision so now we look after our own well it takes a bit of time just to get that adjustment I mean you know you got two smart halves in the opposition that are looking for that that type of that area of where the player is so you know the boys did adjust on the run very quickly but they were able to capitalise on it you know and once all of a sudden you need to flip an extra player across and people adjusting all of a sudden you know you got two smart players in the opposition having to look up and and seeing the opportunities of a short side so you know I thought the boys actually adjusted quite well but um yeah I mean you never you never probably plan for having a bloke off in a circumstance like that where I thought you know it was it was a line call honestly like you’re playing in a game like this and it’s a massive line call and um yeah its disappointing to see him get sent off um but they called that and that’s the way it is well I don’t think anyone’s ever planned for a send off in a uh an origin game so um you know we had all our rotations everything covered you know and I thought you know Huddo went out there in the centres and we had Angus out in the centres at some stage and they actually covered that really well but when you’re twelve men its uh you know you gotta your middle is just working that hard um so you know I really felt that boys worked really hard for each other um you know you can see times there where mate the effort of some of the team as Jakey just said like we come out in the second half and they did exactly what we planned um but unfortunately yeah they got we probably missed a couple of tackles that led to sort of long range tries which uh turns you around well I don’t know whether you call it leniency but I just spoke about it before where um you know earlier in the year there was nothing happened when you know he broke his jaw so I guess this one was line ball because he was actually falling um you know and obviously the height of that just last moment had uh Joey clip him in a bit but big call in a big game like this well those sort of things are definitely worth looking at but I but you know you made a call they made a call and um you know I actually have already received a lot of messages from a lot of people saying how hard the boys tried in that circumstance so you people see that but you know it doesn’t help us right at this moment because you know it was you know the preparation that the boys had had and the way that they’re really working towards what you know this Origin space stands for is being exceptional from the players but at the end of the day we know that we’re chasing a result uh no I didn’t actually no no because I felt what the players have and what they’ve spoken about through the week and as we said we had moments but you know its always a challenge when you’re a man down I won’t make any comments about someone’s game until I go back and have a look at it so that’s you know um you know there are obviously a pretty disappointed changeroom in there and I’m not going to talk about people’s performances here I’ll have a look at it first and talk to them individually you know that’s what I’ll be doing yeah I thought angus Crichton you know I thought across the board you know Payne Haas covered a lot through the middle and you know through circumstance or you know Jakey did some great things at the start but you know the rotation of what we had just didn’t allow us to sort of get that back on having to cover the back rowers and plug the edges so that’s that’s um there’s an number of good performances in and around you know parts of the game that I’ll definitely have a look at uh I’ve been in this circumstance before so I know exactly what we’ll do yeah I obviously talk to the players and you know you have thirteen players out there well the whole game is a different ballgame so uh yeah I’m really confident in where the place or sorry where the players are taking uh what we do oh yeah it was a tough one yeah I didn’t expect him to get sent off if I’m being honest probably because of the enormity of the game but that’s the way it went you know it was tough but as madge said there was periods of the game we were to take a lot of confidence from there probably the first twenty minutes of the second half I thought we were on top you know with twelve men so got to give a lot of credit to the lads they worked really hard and we put ourselves in a position there to be in a you know punchers chance at the back end which was nice yeah just to keep fighting obviously as Madge said we’ve had a great week you know we’ve had a great week of preparations so we come in with a  lot of confidence you know and he said you don’t plan for that sort of thing but just keep fighting keep working hard and just do our best mate and as we said mate we’ve got to take some confidence and be pretty proud of some of the efforts there it was um that was really pleasing definitely without a doubt as we said we take a belief from that and I think the boys showed a lot of fight you know so but yeah we got to take that period moving forward as we said that twenty minute period was a really dominant period with a man down which was um really pleasing but as madge said it’s a long game you know we’ve got to do it for longer periods albeit you know we were down but albeit we’ve got to do it for longer so we’ll take confidence from that and we’ll take belief and we’ll keep working hard
